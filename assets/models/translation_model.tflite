As an AI model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as .tflite files. The file "assets/models/translation_model.tflite" is a TensorFlow Lite model which is used for machine learning purposes. This file is usually trained and exported from a machine learning environment like TensorFlow. It's not something that can be generated by writing code. You should train a model that can translate American Sign Language(ASL) into text and then convert it into a .tflite file using TensorFlow's converter tools. After that, you can place the .tflite file in the "assets/models" directory of your Flutter project.
